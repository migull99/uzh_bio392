# Task 1
## GangSTR background reading

- What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools?
> GangSTR, a novel algorithm for genome-wide genotyping of both short and expanded TRs. <br>
GangSTR outperforms alternative methods in both accuracy and speed.<br>
GangSTR will likely enable discovery of novel disease-associated variants not currently accessible from NGS.

- What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping?
> GangSTR relies on a general statistical model incorporating multiple properties of paired-end reads into a single maximum likelihood framework capable of genotyping both normal length and expanded repeats. <br>
GangSTR can be applied to genotype TRs using high-coverage NGS and validate novel repeat expansions using orthogonal long read and capillary electrophoresis data.
